This repository demonstrates an uncommon Elixir bug related to unexpected process termination within `Enum.each`. The `bug.ex` file contains code that uses `Enum.each` to iterate through a list and terminates the process if a specific condition is met. This behavior might be unexpected because `Enum.each` does not provide a mechanism to handle early termination gracefully, and any subsequent code will not execute. The `bugSolution.ex` provides a more robust solution using `Enum.reduce` or a loop to maintain control flow and handle the termination condition more effectively.
